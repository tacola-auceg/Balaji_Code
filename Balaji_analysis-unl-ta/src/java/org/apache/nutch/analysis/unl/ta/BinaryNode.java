/**
 * version history**
 *version number:1.1
The package   INDEX_BST  consists of Structures(nodes) required to build the application BianrySearchtree 
 * The class BinaryNode consists of Constructors 
 * The BinaryNode is created to store the concept with the help of its hash code
 * The BinaryNodes are Linked in a Bianry Search Tree fashion
 * The Dissimilar concepts having same hash code are stored in BinaryNextNode using the pointer linknext
 * Description of variables
 * -----------------------
 *  asciival-ascivalue of the concept(hash code )which is used to store the concept in BinarySearchTree
 * con-source concept
 * rel-connecting relation
 * tocon-destination concept
 * ind_tamil-the actual tamil word of the concept
 * linknext-pointer to the BinaryNextNode
 * docid-Document id of the concept
 * left-pointer to BinaryNode which stores the concepts having smaller hash code than the root concept
 * right-pointer to BinaryNode which stores the concepts having greater hash code than the root concept
 * docnext-pointer to the next DocNode :*/
